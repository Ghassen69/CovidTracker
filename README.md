# CovidTracker.
Our main goal is to create an application that assists in tracking the spread of the covid-19 virus by providing the most up-to-date information.
To ensure reliability, the project's verification of incoming covid cases has to be improved.

This project is independent. Users can use it wherever they want all over the world.
